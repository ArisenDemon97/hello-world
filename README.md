# hello-world
Basic hello world

Hello, I'm a student of computer sciences. I recently realized how much I enjoy coding and have thus far gone a little code crazy, learning a little bit of C++, Python, C#, Java, and more when I actually get a good grasp on at least one of these. I know I'm not the best, and I certainly don't expect to be. What I do expect, is to get good enough at this to be able to do some serious coding.
